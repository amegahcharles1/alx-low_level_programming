C Programming in Linux Tutorial #024 - open() read() write() Functions
Tasks
All *-main.c files are in the main directory.
Tread lightly, she is near : A function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.
Prototype: ssize_t read_textfile(const char *filename, size_t letters);
Where letters is the number of letters it should read and print.
Returns the actual number of letters it could read and print.
If the file can not be opened or read, return 0.
If filename is NULL return 0
If write fails or does not write the expected amount of bytes, return 0.
Compile the code this way: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 main/0-main.c 0-read_textfile.c -o a
Run this way: ./a main/Requiescat
Under the snow : A function that creates a file.
Prototype: int create_file(const char *filename, char *text_content);
Where filename is the name of the file to create and text_content is a NULL terminated string to write to the file.
Returns: 1 on success, -1 on faliure (file can not be created, file can not be written, write "fails", etc)
The created file must have those permissions: rw-------. If the file already exists, do not change the permissions.
If the file already exists, truncate it.
If filename is NULL return -1
If text_content is NULL create an empty file.
Compile the code this way: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 main/1-main.c 1-create_file.c -o b
Run this way: ./b hello world OR ./b hello "you own this world"
Confirm file permissions: ls -l hello
Confirm file contents: cat hello
You can try to run this way ./b hello "Is the previous data present" to confirm the truncate bit.
Speak gently, she can hear : A function that appends text at the end of a file.
Prototype: int append_text_to_file(const char *filename, char *text_content);
Where filename is the name of the file and text_content is the NULL terminated string to add at the end of the file.
Return: 1 on success and -1 on faliure.
Do not create the file if it does not exist.
If filename is NULL return -1
If text_content is NULL`, do not add anything to the file.
Return 1 if the file exists and -1 if the file does not exit or if you do not have the required permissions to write the file.
Compile the code this way: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 main/2-main.c 2-append\_text\_to\_file.c -o c
Run the following to text the program:
Create hello file: echo -n Hello > hello
Confirm file was created: ls -l hello
View contents of our hello file: cat hello
Run this way: ./c hello " World!   "
View contents again: cat hello
On the same file you can try and see if we pass no text if the file will change: ./c hello ""
cp A program that copies the content of a file to another file.
Usage: cp file_from file_to
If the number of argument is not the correct one, exit with code 97 and print Usage: cp file_from file_to, followed by a new line, on the POSIX standard error.
If file_to already exists, truncate it.
If file_from does not exist, or if you can not read it, exit with code 98 and print Error: Can't read from file NAME_OF_THE_FILE, followed by a new line, on the POSIX standard error.
Where NAME_OF_THE_FILE is the second argument passed to your program.
If you can not create or if write to file_to fails, exit with code 99 and print Error: Can't write to NAME_OF_THE_FILE, followed by a new line, on the POSIX standard error.
Where the NAME_OF_THE_FILE is the second argument passed to your program.
If you can not close a file descriptor , exit with code 100 and print Error: Can't close fd FD_VALUE, followed by a new line, on the POSIX standard error.
Where FD_VALUE is the value of the file descriptor.
Permissions of the created file: rw-rw-r--. If the file already exists, do not change the permissions.
You must read 1,024 bytes at a time from the file_from to make less system calls. Use a buffer.
You are allowed to use dprintf.
Compile the code this way: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 3-cp.c -o cp
To run the program, follow below steps:
View contents of file to copy from: cat main/incitatous
Copy file to new file: ./cp main/incitatous Incitatous
Confirm if file has been created: ls -l Incitatous
Confirm contents: cat Incitatous
elf : A program that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file.
Usage: elf_header elf_filename
Displays the following information: (no less, no more, do not include trailing whitespace)
Magic
Class
Data
Version
OS/ABI
ABI Version
Type
Entry point address
Format: the same as readelf -h (version 2.26.1)
If the file is not an ELF file, or on error, exit with status code 98 and display a comprehensive error message to stderr
You are allowed to use lseek once
You are allowed to use read a maximum of 2 times at runtime
You are allowed to to have as many functions as you want in your source file.
You are allowed to use printf
man elf, readelf will give you details on the functions they use and struct type.
Compile the code this way: ``
Confirm if the code is running by following the below steps:
Run readelf first with the --header / -h option:
  [main !?] root@0331426d386b : [ ~/alx-low_level_programming/0x15-file_io ] 
  $ readelf -h /lib/ld-linux.so.2
